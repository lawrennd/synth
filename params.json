Compile the file f2s.c using gcc (gcc -o f2s f2s.c) and ensure it is in the path.\r\n\r\n### Examples\r\n\r\nThere are two main demonstration files,\r\n\r\n```matlab\r\n>> demEigenvoiceLatent \r\n```\r\n\r\nfor visualizing the latent space of the eigenvoices and\r\n\r\n```matlab\r\n>> demProjectVoices \r\n```\r\n\r\nfor reacreating individual speaker voices by projecting them onto the principal components defined by the other speakers.\r\n\r\nThe [dimensionality reduction toolbox](../dimred/) also makes use of the SYNTH toolbox for some examples of dimensionality reduction.\r\n\r\nPage updated on Sun Sep 6 06:14:25 2009\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-62968536-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
