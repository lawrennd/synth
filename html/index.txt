<h1>Speech Synthesis Software</h1>

<p>This page describes examples of how to use the simple MATLAB interface to the eigenvoice software for generating speech based on the Grid corpus.

<p>This software has been tested on Linux only, it requires the presence of Perl, the HTK, and the SPTK as well as the SoX package. 

RELEASEINFORMATION


<p>This is the first release for the Interspeech tutorial.

<h3>Installation</h3>

<p>Ensure the following binary files are in the path: HMGenS (from HTK), excite, mglsadf (from SPTK). Compile the file f2s.c using gcc (gcc -o f2s f2s.c) and ensure it is in the path.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<p>There are two main demonstration files, 

<p><code>
&gt;&gt; demEigenvoiceLatent
</code>

<p>for visualizing the latent space of the eigenvoices and

<p><code>
&gt;&gt; demProjectVoices
</code>

<p>for reacreating individual speaker voices by projecting them onto the principal components defined by the other speakers.

<p>The <a href="../dimred/">dimensionality reduction toolbox</a> also makes use of the SYNTH toolbox for some examples of dimensionality reduction.
